Scooby-Doo, I know, got to stop the rain Look! It's Mr. Beeman, the real estate agent! Mr. Beeman? Yeah, he was printing millions of counterfeit dollars in the basement with his printing press. What we originally thought was mold was really green ink. See? And I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that pink dog and you meddling kids! And that's how we solved the case of the moat monster, one of our most frightening mysteries. Ooh, stories like that always give me the heebie jeebies!

Ooh! No wonder you became a reporter. That mote monster almost sliced you up like a pepperoni pizza. And then we wouldn't have Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake. Your very successful syndicated series on Americana going on its second season, I might add. I never miss it. Thanks, Chris. You know, the real reason I changed jobs was because the monsters and ghosts always turned out to be bad guys in a mask. Got a little boring, eh? No kidding. In fact, that's why the gang went their separate ways, except for Fred and me. She means Fred Jones, who's now the producer and one-man crew of Daphne's show. How about getting a shot of Freddy, guys? Is he cute or what? So, what's coming up for the new season? A new series of segments called Haunted America. Sort of a ghost-to-ghost with Daphne Blake. Right. But there are great things about that one Pumpkin.

Freddy? Jinkies! Sounds great! Count me in! Like hi, boss! You ate all the contraband! Excuse me? Like, untrue, boss. We didn't eat it all. There's still a couple of gorgonzolas left. Help yourself! You're a couple of gorgonzolas! You're fired! Sheesh! Like, what a grouch! Looks like we're unemployed again, old pal. Ruh? Unemployed? Like, take it easy, buddy. Something will turn up. So what if this was, like, the greatest gig ever? Like, so what if we starve, turn to skin and bones?
